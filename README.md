# CS451FInal

This is the repo for my final project for CS451 in Fall 20.

Please find the source code for all of the pages here. 

The database is designed to emulate a group of people who play dungeons in dragons in various groups and storylines. Perhaps at a local game store or something.

Highlights:

The follow up query from findNumEle.php to findEleSpells.php has a GET operation that I use after storing the variable name in the POST. It is an ok application of a follow up.
Things are formatted somehwat ok into tables.

Otherwise things are pretty straight forward. I do not do anything too fancy.
